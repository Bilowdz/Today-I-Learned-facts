This is currently a website created by following a UDemy course by
Jonas Schmedtmann called "Crash Course: Build a Full-Stack Web App in a Weekend!". The course taught the very basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and database querying with Supabase.

The website is hosted at https://factspage.netlify.app/

The goal of this project is to turn it into some kind of fun Dungeons and Dragons related website. The idea is still in the works.

Technologies used:

- React
- Supabase
